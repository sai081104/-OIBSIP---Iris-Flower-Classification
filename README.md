# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

Hey there! 👋  
This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project I built during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. It predicts the species of an Iris flower using its petal and sepal measurements — clean, quick, and perfect for getting started with ML!

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Loads the **Iris dataset** from a public source  
- Uses features like:
  - Sepal length & width  
  - Petal length & width  
- Trains a **Random Forest Classifier**  
- Predicts the species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica  
- Evaluates accuracy using test data

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff

- Language: **Python**
- Libraries: **pandas**, **scikit-learn**
- ML Algorithm: **Random Forest Classifier**
- Dataset Source: [Iris CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/IRIS.csv)

## 🎯 Why I Made It

This was **Task 1 (Level 1)** of my **Data Science Internship** with Oasis Infobyte.  
The goal was to implement a basic ML model and understand the end-to-end workflow — from loading data to training, predicting, and evaluating results.

## 💻 How to Run It

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Make sure Python and required libraries are installed  
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Task1_Iris_Flower_Classification.py
